Models we saw in papers:

Random Forest using randomized search - 95%
CHAID (Decision Tree) - 90.3%
ANN - 91%
Naive Bayes
kNN with Cross Validation - 88%
SVM (Support Vector Machine) - 89.66%

Combination of SVM and ANN
Combination of kNN and ANN
Random Forest, Naive Bayes, CHAID - 92%
Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Linear SVM are the three
independent base learners that have been used to build the
ensemble model. 
Ensemble - kNN, Naive Bayes, CHAID, Random Forest - 88%
